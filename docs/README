    UUP-MAIL - Mail template and composing library for PHP
=============================================================================

The uup-mail library provides a mail template and composer library for formatting
mail messages. Its main focus is on message composition and layout using templates. 
The actual sending (transport) of the SMTP message is delegated.

This library was not designed to be used as a component library. Instead, it was
designed with inheritance in mind. Create your own mail message classes (one for 
each particular kind of message) derived from class MessageComposer:

    // 
    // Example:
    // 
    class ConfirmSubscriptionMessage extends MessageComposer
    {
            public function __construct()
            {
                    parent::__construct(_("Confirm Subscription", _("...")));
                    // ... create additional section headers with content.
            }

            public function setSubscription($id) 
            {
                    parent::setContent('Subscription', Subscription::get($id));
            }
    }

    $composer = new ConfirmSubscriptionMessage();
    $message  = new SwiftMessage($composer, $formatter);
    $mailer->send($message);

The library can be used at three different levels:

    1. Use UUP\Mail\Compose only. The library is used solely for message composition.

    2. Use i.e. UUP\Mail\Swift. This is the intermediate level were you can take 
       advantage of the message composition and layout, while still have native 
       access to the swiftmailer library too.

    3. Use UUP\Mail and its interface. The programming at this level is done against
       the interfaces (Message and MessageMailer) using the MessageService as a proxy
       against your code and the native implementation, i.e. swiftmailer.

A good example of real world usage can be found in example/realistic.php
